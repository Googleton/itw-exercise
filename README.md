## How to run

### Front-End (c3po)

Inside the `c3po` folder, run the following command: `npm run serve`

### Back-End (rs/mill_falc)

If you do not have Rust installed, you can get it here: https://rustup.rs/

Once Rust is installed, you can head into the `rs/mill_falc` directory and simply run the command `cargo run`

### CLI (rs/r2d2)

If you do not have Rust installed, you can get it here: https://rustup.rs/

Once Rust is installed, you can head into the `rs/r2d2` directory and run the command `cargo run <millenium falcon json path> <empire data json path>`

Configuration files are expected to be in the directory where the `cargo run` command is executed.
